# Hangman-with-Tkinter
This is a simple Hangman game made with Python and the Tkinter package. The program chooses a word from an external text file, and the user needs to enter letters to guess the word in order to win. The user loses if they incorrectly guess five letters.

The external text file contains the majority of countries in Europe.
